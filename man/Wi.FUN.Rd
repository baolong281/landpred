%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Computes the inverse probability of censoring weights for a specific t0 and tau i.e. this computes I(t0 < XL < t0+tau)*DL/G(XL) + I(XL>t0+tau)/G(t0+tau) where XL = min(TL, C), TL is the time of the long term event, C is the censoring time, DL =1*(TL<C) and G() is the estimate survival probability for censoring estimated using the Kaplan Meier estimator (see Ghat.FUN)

%%     ~~Describe \code{data} here~~
n by k matrix, where k>= 2. A data matrix where the first column is XL = min(TL, C) where TL is the time of the long term event, C is the censoring time, and the second column is DL =1*(TL<C)
}
  \item{t0}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{t0} here~~
the landmark time..
}
  \item{tau}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{tau} here~~
